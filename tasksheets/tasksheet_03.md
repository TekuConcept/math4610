# Tasksheet 3

## Task 1: TODO

Implement a version of Newton's method for finding the roots of a function of one variable. Document the code in your software manual.

## Task 2: TODO

Implement a version of the secant method for finding the roots of a function of one variable. Create a page in your software manual to document the code.

## Task 3: TODO

Compare the 4 methods for root finding (functional iteration, bisection, Newton's method, and the secant method using the problems defined in the first two tasks of Task sheet #2.

## Task 4: TODO

Develop and implement a hybrid method for approximate solution of root finding problems in one variable. Use the bisection method to start the algorithm and switch to Newton's method when the iterates are close enough. Create a page in your software manual for this code.

## Task 5: TODO

Repeat the development in Task 4, but replace Newton's method with the secant method. Create a page in your software manual for this code.

## Task 6: TODO

Add the routines created thus far to your shared library. There should be 8 to 10 routines so far in the course.

## Task 7: TODO

In some cases it is necessary to find a number of roots for a function of one variable. Suppose that we know there are several roots in a given interval. Develop code that will break the interval into subintervals and apply the Bisection method to each subinterval. Apply this to the following function `f(x) = sin(pi*x^2 + 3.7)`; Use the interval [1.1, 68.3] . It might pay to identify where the zeros are in this problem.

## Task 8: TODO

Repeat the work from Task 7 using Newton's method.

## Task 9: TODO

Repeat the work from Task 7. using the secant method.

## Task 10: TODO

Search the internet for sites that identify real problems where some root finding problem is used to compute approximate solutions. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
