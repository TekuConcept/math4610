# Tasksheet 1

## Task 1:
[https://tekuconcept.github.io/](https://github.com/TekuConcept/)

## Task 2:
https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610

## Task 3:
(Debian) Linux Mint x86_64 Terminal + Visual Studio Code

## Task 4:
https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/test/target_language.cpp

Can either be compiled using `cmake . && make` or by using `g++ test/target_language.cpp`

## Task 5:
https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc.md

## Task 6: TODO

In class, an example of computational error involving derivatives was given. The approximation was given by a "oned-sided" difference quotient. Use a central difference of the form

f'(x) = [f(x+h) - f(x-h)] / [(x+h) - (x-h)]

to document the same behavior where the error reduces as h decreases until machine precision causes problems.

## Task 7:
* [absolute-error](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/errabs.md)
* [relative-error](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/errrel.md)

## Task 8:

* [absolute-error](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/errabs.md)
* [relative-error](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/errrel.md)
* [single-machine-epsilon](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/smaceps.md)
* [double-machine-epsilon](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/dmaceps.md)

## Task 9: TODO
Write a main program that computes the derivative of the exponential function, `e^x`, at the point `x = Ï€`. Link to your shared library and use the absolute and relative error routines to compute the errors. You can use either the one sided or centered difference approximation for this task.

## Task 10: TODO
Search the internet for sites that discuss absolute and relative errors. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
