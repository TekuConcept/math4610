# Tasksheet 6

## Task 1:
* [cholesky](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/cholesky_matrix.md)

## Task 2: TODO
Write a method that implements Jacobi iteration for solving linear systems of equations. Put an entry in your software manual for this method.

## Task 3: TODO
Write a routine that will create a square matrix with dimension n. Use a random number generator to determine the entries in the matrix. You can use a uniform distribution as the basis for the values created. Put a page in for this method.

## Task 4: TODO
Repeat Task 3 with output that is diagonally dominant as defined in class.

## Task 5: TODO
Repeat Task 3 with output that is a symmetric matrix.

## Task 6: TODO
Repeat Task 3 with output that is both symmetric and diagonally dominant.

## Task 7: TODO
Use each of the matrix generation routines with your Jacobi iteration to test the code. You should generate a matrix with dimension n with n large, create the right hand side of the system by multiplying the matrix on the left into a vector of ones. Then solve the resulting system. You solutions should be close to 1 if your Jacobi iteration is working.

## Task 8: TODO
Implement the Gauss-Seidel method for solving linear systems of equations. Include a software manual page for this method.

## Task 9: TODO
Run the Gauss-Seidel iteration on the same matrices as you created in Task 7. Compare the results of the Jacobi iteration runs to the Gauss-Seidel runs. This means keeping track of the number of iterations for each method.

## Task 10: TODO
Search the internet for sites that document the use of Jacobi iteration and/or Gauss-Seidel. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
