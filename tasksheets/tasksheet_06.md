# Tasksheet 6

## Task 1:
* [cholesky](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/cholesky_matrix.md)

## Task 2:
* [jacobi](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/jacobi_solver_matrix.md)

## Task 3:
* [random](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/random_matrix.md)

## Task 4:
* [random](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/random_matrix.md)

## Task 5:
* [random](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/random_matrix.md)

## Task 6:
* [random](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/random_matrix.md)

## Task 7: TODO
Use each of the matrix generation routines with your Jacobi iteration to test the code. You should generate a matrix with dimension n with n large, create the right hand side of the system by multiplying the matrix on the left into a vector of ones. Then solve the resulting system. Your solutions should be close to 1 if your Jacobi iteration is working.

## Task 8:
* [gauss-seidel](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/seidel_solver_matrix.md)

## Task 9: TODO
Run the Gauss-Seidel iteration on the same matrices as you created in Task 7. Compare the results of the Jacobi iteration runs to the Gauss-Seidel runs. This means keeping track of the number of iterations for each method.

## Task 10: TODO
Search the internet for sites that document the use of Jacobi iteration and/or Gauss-Seidel. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
