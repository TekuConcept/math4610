# Tasksheet 8

## Task 1: TODO
<!-- * [steepest-descent](https://github.com/TekuConcept/math4610/blob/master/modules/doc/steepest_descent_matrix.md) -->
Write code that implements the power method for finding the largest eigenvalue in magnitude of a square matrix. Document the method in your software manual page. Use a symmetric diagonally dominant matrix to test the method and include the results as an example in your software manual.

## Task 2: TODO
Try out your power method on the Hilbert matrix of order n = 10.

## Task 3: TODO
Implement the inverse power method for finding the smallest eigenvalue of a square matrix. Use a symmetric diagonally dominant matrix to test the method and include the results as an example in your software manual.

## Task 4: TODO
Try out your inverse power method on the Hilbert matrix of order n = 10.

## Task 5: TODO
Implement the power method with shifting to try to estimate eignevalues of a matrix. Include a page in your software manual. Try to find as eigenvalues not equal to the largest or smallest. Use a symmetric diagonally dominant matrix to test the code.

## Task 6: TODO
Try out your shifted power method on the Hilbert matrix of order n = 10.

## Task 7: TODO
Knowing that the condition number a matrix in the 2-norm is related to the largest and smallest eigenvalues, write a routine that will compute an estimate of the 2-condition number using the power method and inverse power method.

## Task 8: TODO
Try out the condition number code on the Hilber matrix for n = 10. Does this work?

## Task 9: TODO
Combine the tridiagonal matrix multiplication routine to compute the 2-condition number of a tridiagonal matrix. Use a symmetric diagonally dominant tridiagonal matrix to test the code. Use a tridiagonal matrix with 
n = 10, 100, 1000, 10000. Report the results including execution time.

## Task 10: TODO
Search the internet for sites that document the use of Power iteration and/or Inverse Power Iteration. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
